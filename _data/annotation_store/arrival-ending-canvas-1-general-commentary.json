This hints, like the changing time-scenes, at the large part of the plot where Louise has the abiIity, thanks to her understanding of the new language, to 'see into the future' or for more cohesive terms of the film, she can 'see her life holistically'. So, even though she hasn't, in Ian's perception of time, ever been held by him, she 'remembers', which seems to point to many of the linguistic themes of the film as a 'bad' translation, being in his arms. Maybe, there is even an attempt at labeling this 'bad' translations as a creation themselves to a new or unique understanding of the term itself. ",

This seems to give credit to memory in that way, as opposed to the more controversial and non-linear understanding of time they have been hinting at. So, it could either be the film creators' inclusion of an idea other than their own to give it its own credit, or it could be seen as them including that understanding into their more holistic view of time.

This seems to come up multiple times, where we would assume that since she knows that he is going to ask that question, why would it take her so long to respond? It seems to correlate with a larger theme that is emphasized at the very end of the film that we will get to, but the idea, itself, is that having answers to questions doesn't remove their magical or emotional essence. Much of the film, especially considering the language aspect, deals with the importance of teaching the aliens what a 'question' is. This is because, ultimately, the humans want to ask \"what is your purpose on earth?\" So, this reaction to the question seems to contradict some of the importance and initial response that viewers would have when watching that scene, as now we are being informed that it is the essence of the question, the timelessness of it, not the answer, that makes it beautiful.
