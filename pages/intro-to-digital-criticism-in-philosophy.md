Philosophical inquiries into the discussion of beauty and definition or function of art have been at the center of more general human discussion for millenia. Before we get into the specific realms of film, poetry, or a modern conglomeration of music film and poetry, we will go over the broad critiques of digital art but also art as a whole. It is important to note that through this passage you will get a glimpse into many theories and and definitions that could easily conflict with the story I am going to tell, but I encourage you to think about your experiences with digital art and how each of the pieces in this short collection guide you to feel.

Going back to the everso referenced and beloved Greek philosopher Plato, we see an interesting distinction that still lives within the world of philosophical discussion in regards to art: the aesthetic versus the philosophy of art. Aesthetics, in Plato’s sense and an overall understanding of modern aesthetics, is the study of beauty and includes art and attempts to determine “aesthetic value”. This will work with the different aspects of objects or subjects, some being outside of art, that compose a specific aesthetic response from. Plato introduces a foundational idea of arts and aesthetics being defined by imitation, or specifically the Greek word, mimêsis. This would delve into the idea that things are beautiful through their imitation of more serious or real things, like the actor being good at imitating a very dark and sad moment. Some interpretations of this would lead to the influence of realism, as it seemed to most people that if we find something beautiful, like a flower, in real life, in order to transform that beauty into art, we would want to imitate it as closely as possible. 
<br>
However, there seems to be another aspect that has become a larger influence in the modern understanding of the aesthetic and discussion of art: creation. Berys Gaut in his book The Philosophy of Creativity (2010), Gaut looks into the role of creativity in philosophical questions that reach even further than art, but for our purposes, highlights a very integral aspect of analyzing art and aesthetic value by looking at the aspects of creation. To find something beautiful in something, especially art, then, is to find where one has created something new, or transformed something out of another. They took notes and made a symphony; they grabbed clay and made a sculpture. This project will look at the specific transformation that modern artists do by not only making that transition, but also taking it a step further into the digital realm.

Before we get too far ahead of ourselves, let’s look into some more specific criticisms of digital art to keep in mind when viewing my annotations and essays on the specific forms of art. As we move through time and space, and new art-forms emerge, we see philosophers hold on desperately to their times and beloved forms of art by rejecting those new ones. This was most commonly documented through the development of photography, which can directly relate to both the tensions of imitation and creation. Charles Baudelaire, famously, in The Salon of 1859, offered a fear and interesting discussion on photography and his fear in a growingly mechanical age, much like what we see in Walter Benjamin’s The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction (1936). Baudelaire criticizes photography by saying:
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>“It is useless and tedious to represent what exists, because nothing that exists satisfies me….  I prefer the monsters of my fantasy to what is positively trivial.”</blockquote>
<br>
So, to bring together what this project will hope you to keep in mind while looking through its collection, one should recognize the criticism of the modern world of art, especially through its desire to either make money or reproduce itself as a representation of a capitalist system, but also consider its beauty in terms of what it has transformed into and how aspects of creation or creativity make influence on each of them. To further Benjamin’s interpretation of Baudelaire in his work, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy defines his interpretation as “the transformation of historical time by the commodity form.” Already, we are beginning to see the importance of time and transformation in these “newer” questions of art and aesthetic value, so let’s get into the forms themselves.
