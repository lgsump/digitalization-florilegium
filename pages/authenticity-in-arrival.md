Gilles Deleuze was a French philosopher who worked heavily in the realm of causality,  aesthetic theory, literary theory, and film theory. We’ll be focusing on his two works on film <i> Cinema I: The Movement-Image</i> and <i>Cinema II: The Time-Image</i> published in 1983 and 1985 respectively.

In his major works on film, Deleuze combines the realm of film criticism and philosophy. While both are in many regards considered separate, Deleuze brings them together in these two books in a way that makes them seem undistinguishable and hard to separate. It is important to note that many of the ideas, such as even the names “Movement-Image” and “Time-Image” come from Henri Bergson’s theories on perception. Much of these books are in response to Bergson and those ideas, as he explicitly states in the books. 
<br>
<br>
It is important to discern the idea of repetition and difference whenever thinking of Deleuze’s works. <i>Difference and Repetition</i> (1968) is by some considered Deleuze’s magnum opus and lays the foundation for many of his works. It represents largely the idea of difference in itself and repetition for itself, which are names of sections in his work, which was also his principal thesis. 
<br>
<br>
For our work on transformation and time, we are going to be looking into how Deleuze understands the nature of film and its artistry, and especially in how time and movement, or in our words transformation, play with it at its very foundation. Our inspection on the relationship between modern film and digital art more generally will require us to spend most of our “time” on the second book <i>Cinema II: The Time-Image</i> compared to the first. For clarity’s sake, which is seldom to find at first glance in Deleuze, we can see an integral part of his theory straight from his words in the second book:
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>“Hence a first thesis: it is a montage itself which constitutes the whole, and thus gives us the image of time. It is therefore the principal art of cinema. Time is necessarily an indirect representation, because it flows from the montage which links one movement-image to another.” (34, The Time-Image)</blockquote>
<br>
His understanding of a montage is as a determination of a whole in the way it is warped or represented through its sequence, how the different images are cut, and especially how false continuity is used. This is quite similar to the way we view montages now in some sense, as it is how we can use the clipping of images to represent a very long period of time, and in many ways we can use this manipulation of time, or false continuity, to represent a different idea. We will see this through the chapters on <i>Arrival</i> (2016). Something important to note in his discussion above through the connection of movement-images is that this quote doesn’t necessarily tell us anything about the good or bad aspects of the role of time in film. Deleuze merely points out that this relationship between time and film as an art, and for us through his understanding of transformation from one to another, as a foundational aspect of the discipline. 
<br>
<br>
Within the first book <i>Cinema I: The Movement-Image</i>, Deleuze concludes with his discussion of images and the history of film by criticizing the obsession with movement as its pure self. This book highlights an important material discussion of film and the utility and foundation of movement in film, but many like Deleuze believed that there was a need to move it further. The Time-Image to Deleuze is beyond the Movement-Image by disconnecting the action and how we associate or sensualize those actions. For example, it is when one isolates the sensation, like what one sees or hears, from the specific scene or image itself. This, to Deleuze, reignites the authenticity of movement in film to Deleuze through its reinforcement in the distinct durations. 
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>“From this point of view, time depends on movement itself and belongs to it: it may be defined, in the style of ancient philosophers, as the number of movement. Montage will therefore be a relation of number, variable according to the intrinsic nature of the movements considered in each image, in each shot.” (35, The Time-Image)</blockquote>
<br>
Through this distinction of time through the number of movement, we begin to enter Deleuze’s solution to the cliche crisis of film, and he believes it is with this creation of the Time-Image that will restore the authenticity of film, and what we will argue in the other pieces as a abstracted version to restore the authenticity of all digital art. Deleuze continues to argue from this distinction the use of illusion and falsity in regards to creation and novelty. This is where we get into the technical aspect of the Crystal-Image. The Crystal-Image is a depiction and unison of the real and imaginary, the virtual and actual through the structuralization of time, or non-chronological time. This specific understanding of time is important in that it expresses the seemingly paradoxical or false nature of time, but it also comes from an influence on Deleuze from Bergson on the split of time in habitual memory. To attempt a brief explanation of this dissonance, the very present-like nature of memories is in seeming conflict with the knowledge that the experience and event happened not at the present but within the past. Through this, the Crystal-Image represents this split in time and allows for us to not see film like we often do, as images that have come before, but also one that moves beyond those images to transform into a world of its own. We see this conjunction of the virtual and the real here in the quote:
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>“Subjectivity is never ours, it is time, that is the soul or the spirit, the virtual. The actual is always objective, but the virtual is subjective: it was initially the affect, that which we experience in time; then time itself, pure virtuality which divides itself in two as affector and affected, ‘the affection of self by self as definition of time.” (82, The Time-Image)</blockquote>
<br>
To further apply this confusing conversation to a more realistic sense, the understanding of the Crystal-Image is by the tension between time and illusion. In one sense, these images come through the likes of remembering, dreams, fantasy, allegory, or even déjà vu. In the world of film, Deleuze solidifies his understanding of this illusion as a creation that splits the time of the present, future, and past. This play with time allows the new aspects of film, the aspects of film that he called for with the publishing of this book, to come to life and form a new reality. We will now take a closer look at a personal favorite of mine that I believe articulates this well: <i>Arrival</i> (2016).
