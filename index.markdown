<h2> A Florilegium </h2>
<hr>
A florilegium, as shown above, is rooted from a term that describes a book that is filled with paintings of flowers. I will, and attempt to, describe this project as a Digital Florilegium. Firstly, it is a collection of art, digital art, including both poem recordings and film. I am also using it as an allegory itself, as to say that each of the parts of this collection can be seen as individual pieces of art themselves, but I am also drawing a larger conclusion among the works. 
<br>
<br>
As per transformation, the theme that I will be drawing from the multiple types of media in this collection will be their role in being transformative for the art themselves. Within the idea of transformation, time is a very integral and implied aspect, so through each of the pages, I will be highlighting both their specific transformations-- either through adaptation from one work of art to the other, or the overall digitalization of art as the transformation-- as well as how the constraints of our perception of time and the opportunity that time encompasses work through each of them.
