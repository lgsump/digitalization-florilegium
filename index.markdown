<h2> Why a florilegium? What is a florilegium?</h2>
<hr>
A florilegium, as shown above, is rooted from a term that describes a book that is filled with paintings of flowers. I will, and attempt to, describe this project as a digital florilegium. Firstly, it is a collection of digital art including recordings, music, and film. I am also using it as an allegory itself, as to say that each piece of this collection can be seen as individual works, but I am also drawing together a larger picture of time and transformation between them. 
<br>
<br>
As per transformation, the theme that I will be illustrating from the multiple types of media in this collection will be their role in being transformative. Within the idea of transformation, time is a very integral and implied aspect. Transformation works with both before and after, which leads or begs the question of causality or seriality. So, through each of the pages, I will be highlighting both their specific transformations-- either through adaptation from one work of art to the other, or the overall digitalization of art as the transformation-- as well as how the constraints of our perception of time and the opportunity that time encompasses and how they work through each of piece.
<br>
<br>
Lastly, each page will be given a flower from the original whole picture shown above, to both connect the pages themselves as art and to reemphasize the project's argument about art by juxtaposing the 'traditional' form of art, the florilegium and paintings, with the modern, digitalized art.
