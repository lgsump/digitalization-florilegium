18	43	TOM: To begin with, I turn bark time. I reverse it to that quaint period, the thirties, when the huge middle class of America was matriculating in a school for the blind. Their eyes had failed them or they had failed their eyes, and so they were having their fingers pressed forcibly down on the fiery Braille alphabet of a dissolving economy.	Transcription	Time
45	106	TOM: In Spain there was revolution. Here there was only shouting and confusion. In Spain there was Guernica. Here there were disturbances of labour, sometimes pretty violent, in otherwise peaceful cities such as Chicago, Cleveland, Saint Louis. . . .This is the social background of the play.	Transcription	
107	156	TOM: The play is memory. Being a memory play, it is dimly lighted, it is sentimental, it is not realistic. In memory everything seems to happen to music. That explains the fiddle in the wings. I am the narrator of the play, and also a character in it. The other characters are my mother Amanda, my sister Laura and a gentleman caller who appears in the final scenes. He is the most realistic character in the play, being an emissary from a world of reality that we were somehow set apart from. But since I have a poet's weakness for symbols, I am using this character also as a symbol; he is the long-delayed but always expected something that we live for. There is a fifth character in the play who doesn't appear except in this larger-thanlife-size photograph over the mantel. This is our father who left us a long time ago.He was a telephone man who fell in love with long distances; he gave up his job with the telephone company and skipped the light fantastic out of town. . . .The last we heard of him was a picture postcard from Mazatlan, on the Pacific coast of Mexico, containing a message of two words - 'Hello - Good-bye!' and no address.I think the rest of the play will explain itself ...

161	162	TOM: Yes, Mother?	Transcription	
162	165	AMANDA: We can't say grace until you come to the table!	Transcription	
165	166	TOM: I'm coming.	Transcription	
183	208	AMANDA: For these and all thy mercies, God's holy name we praise. You know, Laura, I had the funniest experience in Church last Sunday. The Church was crowded except for one pew way down in front, and in that, was just one little woman. I smiled very sweetly at her and I said, 'Excuse me, but would you mind if I share this pew?' 'I certainly would,' she said, 'This space is rented.' Do you know, that's the first time I ever knew that the Lord rented space.	Transcription	
210	238	AMANDA: Tom, honey, don't push with your fingers. If you have to push with something, the thing to push with is a crust of bread. And chew !chew! Animals have sections in their stomachs which enable them to digest food without mastication, but human beings are supposed to chew their food before they swallow it down. Eat food leisurely, son, and really enjoy it. A well-cooked meal has lots of delicate flavours that have to be held in the mouth for appreciation. So chew your food and give your salivary glands a chance to function!	Transcription	
239	257	TOM: Mother, I haven't enjoyed one bite of this dinner because of your constant directions on how to eat it. It's you that makes me rush through meals with your hawk-like attention to every bite I take. Sickening - spoils my appetite - all this discussion of - animals' secretion - salivary glands - mastication!	Transcription	
257	262	AMANDA: Temperament like a Metropolitan star! You're not excused from the table.	Transcription	
262	263	TOM: I'm getting a cigarette.	Transcription	
264.1	264.8	AMANDA: You smoke too much.	Transcription	
265.1	265.9	LAURA: I'll bring in the coffee.	Transcription	
266	269	AMANDA: No, sister, no, sister - you be the lady this time and I'll be the darkey.	Transcription	
270.1	270.5	LAURA: I'm already up.	Transcription	
270.7	276.4	AMANDA: Resume your seat, little sister, I want you to stay fresh and pretty for gentleman callers!	Transcription	
276.6	278.2	LAURA: I'm not expecting any gentleman callers.	Transcription	
278.4	285	AMANDA: Sometimes they come when they are least expected! Why, I remember one Sunday afternoon in Blue Mountain -	Transcription	
286	287	TOM: I know what's coming.	Transcription	
288	292	LAURA: Yes. But let her tell it. She loves to tell it.	Transcription	
292.9	307	AMANDA: One Sunday afternoon in Blue Mountain, your mother received seventeen! gentlemen callers! Why, sometimes there weren't chairs enough to accommodate them all. We had to send the colored boy over to bring in folding chairs from the parish house.	Transcription	
308	310.4	TOM: How did you entertain those gentleman callers?	Transcription	
310.6	312	AMANDA: I understood the art of conversation!	Transcription	
313	313.6	TOM: I bet you could talk.	Transcription	
314	317	AMANDA: Girls in those days knew how to talk, I can tell you.	Transcription	
318	332.4	AMANDA: They knew how to entertain their gentlemen callers. It wasn't enough for a girl to be possessed of a pretty face and a graceful figure although I wasn't slighted in either respect. She also needed to have a nimble wit and a tongue to meet all occasions.	Transcription	
332.6	333	TOM: What did you talk about?	Transcription	
334	539	AMANDA: Things of importance going on in the world ! Never anything coarse or common or vulgar.	Transcription	
340	349	AMANDA: My callers were gentleman -all! Among my callers were some of the most prominent young planters of the Mississippi Delta - planters and sons of planters!	Transcription	
350	366	AMANDA: There was young Champ Laughlin who later became vice-president of the Delta Planters Bank. Hadley Stevenson who was drowned in Moon Lake and left his widow one hundred and fifty thousand in Government bonds.	Transcription	
368	410.3	AMANDA: There were the Cutrere brothers, Wesley and Bates. Bates was one of my bright particular beaux! He got in a quarrel with that wild Wainwright boy. They shot it out on the floor of Moon Lake Casino. Bates was shot through the stomach. Died in the ambulance on his way to Memphis. His widow was also well provided for, came into eight or ten thousand acres, that's all. She married him on the rebound - never loved her - carried my picture on him the night he died !And there was that boy that every girl in the Delta had set her cap for! That beautiful, brilliant young Fitzhugh boy from Greene County!	Transcription	
410.6	412	TOM: What did he leave his widow?	Transcription	
413	417	AMANDA: He never married ! Gracious, you talk as though all of my old admirers had turned up their toes to the daisies !	Transcription	
418	420.2	TOM: Isn't this the first you've mentioned that still survives ?	Transcription	
420.6	441.2	AMANDA: That Fitzhugh boy went North and made a fortune - came to be known as the Wolf of Wall Street! He had the Midas touch, whatever he touched turned to gold! And I could have been Mrs Duncan J. Fitzhugh, mind you! But what did I do- I just went out of my way and picked your father !	Transcription	
441.4	442	LAURA [rising]: Mother, let me clear the table.	Transcription	
443	456.2	AMANDA: No, dear, you go in front and study your typewriter chart. Or practise your shorthand a little. Stay fresh and pretty! It's almost time for our gentlemen callers to start arriving. [She flounces girlishly toward the kitchenette.] How many do you suppose we're going to entertain this afternoon?	Transcription	
456.5	458	LAURA [alone in the dining-room]: I don't believe we're going to receive any, Mother.	Transcription	
459	463	AMANDA [reappearing, airily ] What? Not one - not one? You must be joking!	Transcription	
464	571	AMANDA: Not one gentleman caller? It can't be true ! There must be a flood, there must have been a tornado!	Transcription	
472	485	LAURA: It isn't a flood, it's not a tornado, Mother. I'm just not popular like you were in Blue Mountain. ... [Tom utters another groan. LAURA glances at him with a faint, apologetic smile. Her voice catching a little.] Mother's afraid I'm going to be an old maid.	Transcription	
528	530	LAURA: Hello, Mother, I was - [She makes a nervous gesture toward the chart on the Wall. AMANDA leans against the shut door and stares at LAURA with a martyred look.]	Transcription	
531	535	AMANDA: Deception ? Deception ? [She slowly removes her hat and gloves, continuing the sweet suffering stare. She lets the hat and gloves fall on the floor - a bit of acting.]	Transcription	
541	552	LAURA [shakily]: How was the DAR. meeting? Didn't you go to the DAR. meeting, Mother?	Transcription	
553	572	AMANDA [faintly, almost inaudibly]: - No. - No. [Then more forcibly.] I did not have the strength - to go to the DAR. In fact, I did not have the courage! I wanted to find a hole in the ground and hide myself in it for ever ! [She crosses slowly to the wall and removes the diagram of the typewriter keyboard. She holds it in front of her for a second, staring at it sweetly and sorrowfully - then bites her lips and tears it into two pieces.]	Transcription	
577	580	LAURA [faintly]: Why did you do that, Mother? [AMANDA repeats the same procedure with the chart of the Gregg alphabet.] Why are you ??	Transcription	
580.2	586	AMANDA: Why? Why? How old are you, Laura?	Transcription	
586.5	588.7	LAURA: Mother, you know my age.	Transcription	
589	595	AMANDA: I thought that you were an adult; it seems that I was mistaken. [She crosses slowly to the sofa and sinks down and stares at LAURA.]	Transcription	
598	600	LAURA: Please don't stare at me, Mother.	Transcription	
603	611	AMANDA: What are we going to do, what is going to become of us, what is the future?	Transcription	
612	619	LAURA: Has something happened, Mother? [AMANDA draws a long breath and takes out the handkerchief again. Dabbing process.] Mother, has - something happened?	Transcription	
620	627	AMANDA: I'll be all right in a minute, I'm just bewildered [Count five.] - by life. ...	Transcription	
628	631	LAURA: Mother, I wish that you would tell me what's happened!	Transcription	
633	649	AMANDA: As you know, I was supposed to be inducted into my office at the D.A.R. this afternoon.  But I stopped off at Rubicam's business college to speak to your teachers about your having a cold and ask them what progress they thought you were making down there.	Transcription	
649.4	649.6	LAURA: Oh....	Transcription	
650	753	AMANDA: I went to the typing instructor and introduced myself as your mother. She didn't know who you were. Wingfield, she said. We don't have any such student enrolled at the school! I assured her she did, that you had been going to classes since early in January. 'I wonder,' she said, 'if you could be talking about that terribly shy little girl who dropped out of school after only a few days' attendance?' 'No,' I said, 'Laura, my daughter, has been going to school every day for the past six weeks !' 'Excuse me,' she said. She took the attendance book out and there was your name, unmistakably printed, and all the dates you were absent until they decided that you had dropped out of school. I still said, 'No, there must have been some mistake I There must have been some mix-up in the records !' And she said, 'No - I remember her perfectly now. Her hands shook so that she couldn't hit the right keys ! The first time we gave a speed-test, she broke down completely - was sick at the stomach and almost had to be carried into the wash-room! After that morning she never showed up any more. We phoned the house but never got any answer' -while I was working at Famous and Barr, I suppose, demonstrating those - Oh! I felt so weak I could barely keep on my feet ! I had to sit down while they got me a glass of water ! Fifty dollars' tuition, all of our plans - my hopes and ambition for you - just gone up the spout, just gone up the spout like that. [LAURA draws a long breath and gets awkwardly to her feet She crosses to the victrola and winds it up.] Oh, don't do that, Laura, don't play that big trolla. 	Transcription	
754	755	LAURA: Oh I [She releases the handle and returns to her seat.]	Transcription	
756	763	AMANDA: Laura? Laura, where have you been going when you've gone on pretending that you were going to business college ?	Transcription	
764	765.6	LAURA: I've just been going out walking.	Transcription	
766	767	AMANDA: That's not true.	Transcription	
767.6	771	LAURA: It is. I just went walking.	Transcription	
772	782	AMANDA: Walking? Walking? In winter? Deliberately courting pneumonia in that light coat? Where did you walk to, Laura?	Transcription	
782.5	786.4	LAURA: All sorts of places - mostly in the park.	Transcription	
788	790.3	AMANDA: Even after you'd started catching that cold?	Transcription	
790.6	799	LAURA: It was the lesser of two evils, Mother. [IMAGE: WINTER SCENE IN PARK.] I couldn't go back up. I threw up -on the floor !	Transcription	
799.8	808	AMANDA: From half past seven till after five every day you mean to tell me you walked around in the park, because you wanted to make me think that you were still going to Rubicam's Business College?	Transcription	
808.4	813.4	LAURA: It wasn't as bad as it sounds. I went inside places to get warmed up	Transcription	
813.6	815	AMANDA: Inside where?	Transcription	
815.3	836	LAURA: I went in the art museum and the bird-houses at the Zoo. I visited the penguins every day! Sometimes I did without lunch and went to the movies. Lately I've been spending most of my afternoons in the jewel-box, that big glass-house where they raise the tropical flowers.	Transcription	
836.7	842	AMANDA: You did all this to deceive me, just for deception? [LAURA looks down.] Why?	Transcription	
842.5	850.2	LAURA: Mother, when you're disappointed, you get that awful suffering look on your face, like the picture of Jesus' mother in the museum !	Transcription	
850.5	851	AMANDA: Hush !	Transcription	
851.2	852	LAURA: I couldn't face it.	Transcription	
857	945	AMANDA [hopelessly fingering the huge pocketbook]: So what are we going to do the rest of our lives? Stay home and watch the parades go by? Amuse ourselves with the glass menagerie, darling? Eternally play those worn-out phonograph records your father left as a painful reminder of him? We won't have a business career - we've given that up because it gave us nervous indigestion ! [Laughs wearily.] What is there left but dependency all our lives? I know so well what becomes of unmarried women who aren't prepared to occupy a position. I've seen such pitiful cases in the South - barely tolerated spinsters living upon the grudging patronage of sister's husband or brother's wife ! - stuck away in some little mousetrap of a room - encouraged by one in-law to visit another - little birdlike women without any nest - eating the crust of humility all their life ! Is that the future that we've mapped out for ourselves? I swear it's the only alternative I can think of ! It isn't a very pleasant alternative, is it? Of course - some girls do marry! [LAURA twists her hands nervously.] Haven't you ever liked some boy?	Transcription	
945.2	950	LAURA: Yes. I liked one once. [Rises.] I came across his picture a while ago.	Transcription	
951	952	AMANDA [with some interest]. He gave you his picture?	Transcription	
953	954.2	LAURA: No, it's in the year-book.	Transcription	
954.4	955.5	AMANDA: [disappointed]: Oh - a high-school boy.	Transcription	
955.7	964	LAURA: Yes. His name was Jim. [LAURA lifts the heavy annual from the claw-foot table.] Here he is in The Pirates of Penzance.	Transcription	
964.8	965.2	AMANDA [absently]: The what?	Transcription	
965.6	982	LAURA: The operetta the senior class put on. He had a wonderful voice and we sat across the aisle from each other Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays in the Aud. Here he is with the silver cup for debating !See his grin?	Transcription	
983	984.2	AMANDA [absently]: He must have had a jolly disposition.	Transcription	
985.4	989.4	LAURA: He used to call me - Blue Roses.	Transcription	
990	992	AMANDA: Why did he call you such a name as that?	Transcription	
992.3	1034	LAURA: When I had that attack of pleurosis - he asked me what was the matter when I came back. I Said pleurosis he thought that I said Blue Roses ! So that's what he always called me after that. Whenever he saw me, he'd holler, 'Hello, Blue Roses ! I didn't care for the girl that he went out with. Emily Meisenbach. Emily was the best-dressed girl at school. She never struck me, though, as being sincere. . . . It says in the Personal Section - they're engaged. That's a long time ago. They must be married by now.	Transcription	
1034.5	1044	AMANDA: Girls that aren't cut out for business careers usually wind up married to some nice man. [Gets up with aspark of revival.] Sister, that's what you'll do !	Transcription	
1045	1046	LAURA: But, Mother	Transcription	
1046.2	1046.8	AMANDA: Yes ? [Crossing to photograph.]	Transcription	
1048	1049	LAURA [in a tone of frightened apology]: I'm - crippled !	Transcription	
1050	1076	AMANDA: Nonsense ! Laura, I've told you never, never to use that word. Why, you're not crippled, you just have a little defect - hardly noticeable, even! When people have some slight disadvantage like that, they cultivate other things to make up for it - develop charm - and vivacity and - charm! That's all you have to do ![She turns again to the photograph.] One thing your father had plenty of - was charm!	Transcription	
1097	1117	TOM: After the fiasco at Rubicam's Business College, the idea of getting a gentleman caller for Laura began to play a more and more important part in Mother's calculations. It became an obsession. Like some archetype of the universal unconscious, the image of the gentleman caller haunted our small apartment. ...	Transcription	
1119	1173	TOM: Even when he wasn't mentioned, his presence hung in Mother's preoccupied look and in my sister's frightened, apologetic manner - hung like a sentence passed upon the Wingfields ! Mother was a woman of action as well as words. She began to take logical steps in the planned direction. Late that winter and in the early spring - realizing that extra money would be needed to properly feather the nest and plume the bird - she conducted a vigorous campaign on the- telephone, roping in subscribers to one of those magazines for matrons called The Home-maker's Companion, the type of journal that features the serialized , sublimations of ladies of letters who think in terms of eyes like wood-smoke in autumn, fingers that soothe and caress like strains of music, bodies as powerful as Etruscan sculpture.	Transcription	
1175	1248	AMANDA: Ida Scott? This is Amanda Wingfield! We missed you at the D.A.R. meeting last Monday! I said to myself: She's probably suffering with that sinus condition ! How is that sinus condition? Horrors ! Heaven have mercy !- You're a Christian martyr, yes, that's what you are, a Christian martyr ! Well, I just have happened to notice that your subscription to the Companion's about to expire! Yes, it expires with the next issue, honey !- just when that wonderful new serial by Bessie Mae Hopper is getting off to such an exciting start. Oh, honey, it's something that you can't miss !You remember how 'Gone With the Wind' took everybody by storm? You simply couldn't go out if you hadn't read it. All everybody talked was Scarlet O'Hara. Well, this is a book that critics already compare to Gone With the Wind. It's the 'Gone With the Wind' of the post-World War generation! - What? -Burning !- Oh, honey, don't let them burn, go take a look in the oven and I'll hold- Heavens - I think she's hung up ! ... Oh, Tom! Tom, do you know what she did? She hung up on me. 	Transcription	
1248	1250.5	LAURA: Mother, Mother! Tom's trying to write!	Transcription	
1250.6	1258	AMANDA: Oh? So he is... So he is! Why can't you sit up straight?	Transcription	
1259	1262	TOM: Mother! Please go busy yourself with something else. I'm trying to write	Transcription	
1262.2	1269	AMANDA: Now, I've seen a medical chart. And I know what that position does to your internal organs! Now you sit up and I'll shoo!	Transcription	
1269.4	1270.2	TOM: What in Christ's name am !	Transcription	
1270.3	1271	AMANDA [shrilly]: Don't you use that -	Transcription

1276.2	1278.2	TOM: I have, that's true, driven out !	Transcription	
1278.5	1280.2	AMANDA: What is the matter with you, you - big - big IDIOT !	Transcription	
1280.5	1283.4	TOM: Look !- I've got no thing, no single thing !	Transcription	
1283.6	1284.2	AMANDA: Lower Your Voice !	Transcription	
1284.8	1286	TOM: In my life here that I can call my OWN !	Transcription	
1286.2	1287	AMANDA: Stop that shouting !	Transcription	
1287.2	1290	TOM: Yesterday you confiscated my books ! You had the nerve -	Transcription	
1290.2	1305.2	AMANDA: I took that horrible novel back to the library- yes ! That hideous book by that insane Mr. Lawrence. [Tom laughs wildly.] I cannot control the output of diseased minds or people who cater to them - [Tom laughs still more wildly.] BUT I WON'T ALLOW SUCH FILTH BROUGHT INTO MY HOUSE ! NO, no, no, no, no !	Transcription	
1305.6	1309	TOM: My house, my house ! Who pays rent on it, who makes a slave of himself to -	Transcription	
1310	1310.9	AMANDA [fairly screeching]: Don't you DARE to -	Transcription	
1311	1314.2	TOM: No, no, I mustn't say anything ! I've just got to keep quiet-	Transcription	
1314.5	1315.2	AMANDA: Let me tell you -	Transcription	
1315.4	1316	TOM: I don't want to hear any more! [He tears the portières open. The upstage area is lit with a turgid smoky red glow.]	Transcription	
1316.8	1318	AMANDA: You will hear more, you -	Transcription	
1318.1	1319	TOM: No, I won' t hear more, I'm going out !	Transcription	
1319	1320	AMANDA: You come right back in -	Transcription	
1320.1	1320.5	TOM: Out!	Transcription	
1320.7	1323.4	AMANDA: Come back here, Tom Wingfield ! I'm not through talking to you !	Transcription	
1323.7	1324.2	TOM: Oh, go -	Transcription	
1324.4	1325.2	LAURA [desperately]: Tom !	Transcription	
1325.6	1330	AMANDA: You're going to listen, and no more insolence from you ! I'm at the end of my patience !	Transcription	
1330.1	1342	TOM: What do you think I'm at the end of? Aren't I supposed to have any patience to reach the end of, Mother? I know, I know. It seems unimportant to you, what I'm doing - and what I want to do - having a slight difference between them !You don't think -	Transcription	
1342.3	1371	AMANDA: I think you've been doing things that you're ashamed of. That's why you act like this. I don't believe that you go every night to the movies every night. Nobody goes to the movies night after night. Nobody in their right mind goes to the movies as often as you pretend to. People don't go to the movies at nearly midnight, and movies don't let out at two a.m. Come in stumbling. Muttering to yourself like a maniac! You get three hours' sleep and then go to work. Oh, I can picture the way you're doing down there. Moping, doping, because you're in no condition.	Transcription	
1371.2	1373.4	TOM [wildly]: No, I'm in no condition !	Transcription	
1373.6	1379	AMANDA: What right have you got to jeopardize your job - jeopardize the security of us all? How do you think we'd manage if you were -	Transcription	
1379.6	1425.5	TOM: Listen !You think I'm crazy about the warehouse? [He bonds fiercely toward her slight figure.] You think I'm in love with the Continental Shoemakers? You think I want to spend fifty- five years down there in that - celotex interior!  Look! I'd rather somebody picked up a crowbar and battered out my brains - than go back mornings! But I go ! Every time you come in yelling……… that God damn 'Rise and Shine!'- 'Rise and Shine!' I say to myself, 'How lucky dead people are ! 'But I get up. I go! For sixty-five dollars a month I give up all that I dream of doing and being ever! And you say self - selfs' all I ever think of. Why, listen, if self is what I thought of, Mother, I'd be where he is -G O N E ! [Pointing to fathers picture.] As far as the system of transportation reaches ! [He starts past her. She grabs his arm.] Don't grab at me, Mother !	Transcription	
1425.9	1428.8	AMANDA: I'm not grabbing at you, I just wanna know where are you going?	Transcription	
1429	1429.6	TOM: I'm going to the movies!	Transcription	
1429.8	1431.1	AMANDA: I don't believe that lie !	Transcription	
1431.3	1492	TOM [crouching toward her, overtowering her tiny figure. She backs away, gasping]: No? Well, you're right. For once in your life you're right. I'm going to opium dens ! Yes, opium dens, dens of vice and criminals' hang-outs, Mother. I've joined the Hogan gang, I'm a hired assassin, I carry a tommy-gun in a violin case! I run a string of cathouses in the Valley! They call me Killer, Killer Wingfield, I'm leading a double-life, a simple, honest warehouse worker by day, by night a dynamic tsar of the underworld, Mother. I go to gambling casinos, I spin away fortunes on the roulette table ! I wear a patch over one eye and a false moustache, sometimes I put on green whiskers. On those occasions they call me -El Diablo ! Oh, I could tell you things to make you sleepless ! My enemies plan to dynamite this place. They're going to blow us all sky-high some night ! And will I be glad, and so will you ! You'll go up, up on a broomstick, over Blue Mountain with seventeen gentlemen callers! You ugly - babbling old - witch. [He goes through a series of violent, clumsy movements, seizing his overcoat, lunging to do door, pulling it fiercely open. The women watch him, aghast. His arm catches in the sleeve of the coat as he struggles to pull it on. For a moment he is pinioned by the bulky garment. With an outraged groan he tears the coat of again, splitting the shoulder of it, and hurls it across the room.
