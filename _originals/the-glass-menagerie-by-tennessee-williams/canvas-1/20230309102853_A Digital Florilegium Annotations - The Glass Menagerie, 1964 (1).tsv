1.702067	17.247609	TOM: I have tricks in my pocket, I have things up my sleeve. But I am the opposite of a stage magician. He gives you illusion that has the appearance of truth. I give you truth in the pleasant disguise of illusion.	Transcription	
18.731496	44.493823	TOM: To begin with, I turn bark time. I reverse it to that quaint period, the thirties, when the huge middle class of America was matriculating in a school for the blind. Their eyes had failed them or they had failed their eyes, and so they were having their fingers pressed forcibly down on the fiery Braille alphabet of a dissolving economy.	Transcription	Time
44.710313	67.436679	TOM: In Spain there was revolution. Here there was only shouting and confusion. In Spain there was Guernica. Here there were disturbances of labour, sometimes pretty violent, in otherwise peaceful cities such as Chicago, Cleveland, Saint Louis. . . .This is the social background of the play.	Transcription	
67.707292	156.71889	TOM: The play is memory. Being a memory play, it is dimly lighted, it is sentimental, it is not realistic. In memory everything seems to happen to music. That explains the fiddle in the wings. I am the narrator of the play, and also a character in it. The other characters are my mother Amanda, my sister Laura and a gentleman caller who appears in the final scenes. He is the most realistic character in the play, being an emissary from a world of reality that we were somehow set apart from. But since I have a poet's weakness for symbols, I am using this character also as a symbol; he is the long-delayed but always expected something that we live for. There is a fifth character in the play who doesn't appear except in this larger-thanlife-size photograph over the mantel. This is our father who left us a long time ago.He was a telephone man who fell in love with long distances; he gave up his job with the telephone company and skipped the light fantastic out of town. . . .The last we heard of him was a picture postcard from Mazatlan, on the Pacific coast of Mexico, containing a message of two words - 'Hello - Good-bye!' and no address.I think the rest of the play will explain itself ...

158.28913	161.324927	AMANDA: Tom? Tom?	Transcription	
161.420041	162.799962	TOM: Yes, Mother?	Transcription	
162.817504	165.498473	AMANDA: We can't say grace until you come to the table!	Transcription	
165.621133	166.679072	TOM: I'm coming.	Transcription	
174.92793	179.083025	AMANDA: For these and all thy mercies, God's holy name we praise. You know, Laura, I had the funniest experience in Church last Sunday. The Church was crowded except for one pew way down in front, and in that, was just one little woman. I smiled very sweetly at her and I said, 'Excuse me, but would you mind if I share this pew?' 'I certainly would,' she said, 'This space is rented.' Do you know, that's the first time I ever knew that the Lord rented space.	Transcription	
183.307948	209.741878	AMANDA: Tom, honey, don't push with your fingers. If you have to push with something, the thing to push with is a crust of bread. And chew !chew! Animals have sections in their stomachs which enable them to digest food without mastication, but human beings are supposed to chew their food before they swallow it down. Eat food leisurely, son, and really enjoy it. A well-cooked meal has lots of delicate flavours that have to be held in the mouth for appreciation. So chew your food and give your salivary glands a chance to function!	Transcription	
210.375705	242.553806	TOM: Mother, I haven't enjoyed one bite of this dinner because of your constant directions on how to eat it. It's you that makes me rush through meals with your hawk-like attention to every bite I take. Sickening - spoils my appetite - all this discussion of - animals' secretion - salivary glands - mastication!	Transcription	
242.789829	261.139997	AMANDA: Temperament like a Metropolitan star! You're not excused from the table.	Transcription	
261.243539	266.188468	TOM: I'm getting a cigarette.	Transcription	
266.443972	267.593739	AMANDA: You smoke too much.	Transcription	
267.721491	268.679631	LAURA: I'll bring in the coffee.	Transcription	
268.791414	270.514148	AMANDA: No, sister, no, sister - you be the lady this time and I'll be the darkey.	Transcription	
270.646567	273.332792	LAURA: I'm already up.	Transcription	
273.389543	274.316479	AMANDA: Resume your seat, little sister, I want you to stay fresh and pretty for gentleman callers!	Transcription	
274.392148	279.93485	LAURA: I'm not expecting any gentleman callers.	Transcription	
280.161855	282.318401	AMANDA: Sometimes they come when they are least expected! Why, I remember one Sunday afternoon in Blue Mountain -	Transcription	
282.450821	289.923065	TOM: I know what's coming.	Transcription	
290.139051	291.631716	LAURA: Yes. But let her tell it. She loves to tell it.	Transcription	
291.691359	296.582032	AMANDA: One Sunday afternoon in Blue Mountain, your mother received seventeen! gentlemen callers! Why, sometimes there weren't chairs enough to accommodate them all. We had to send the colored boy over to bring in folding chairs from the parish house.	Transcription	
296.641674	311.358843	TOM: How did you entertain those gentleman callers?	Transcription	
311.832363	314.225402	AMANDA: I understood the art of conversation!	Transcription	
314.328885	316.825407	TOM: I bet you could talk.	Transcription	
317.006501	318.325907	AMANDA: Girls in those days knew how to talk, I can tell you.	Transcription	
318.403519	335.909991	AMANDA: They knew how to entertain their gentlemen callers. It wasn't enough for a girl to be possessed of a pretty face and a graceful figure although I wasn't slighted in either respect. She also needed to have a nimble wit and a tongue to meet all occasions.	Transcription	
336.117702	337.571678	TOM: What did you talk about?	Transcription	
337.779388	343.096786	AMANDA: Things of importance going on in the world ! Never anything coarse or common or vulgar.	Transcription	
343.346039	353.814666	AMANDA: My callers were gentleman -all! Among my callers were some of the most prominent young planters of the Mississippi Delta - planters and sons of planters!	Transcription	
354.063919	370.310989	AMANDA: There was young Champ Laughlin who later became vice-president of the Delta Planters Bank. Hadley Stevenson who was drowned in Moon Lake and left his widow one hundred and fifty thousand in Government bonds.	Transcription	
370.774312	412.473391	AMANDA: There were the Cutrere brothers, Wesley and Bates. Bates was one of my bright particular beaux! He got in a quarrel with that wild Wainwright boy. They shot it out on the floor of Moon Lake Casino. Bates was shot through the stomach. Died in the ambulance on his way to Memphis. His widow was also well provided for, came into eight or ten thousand acres, that's all. She married him on the rebound - never loved her - carried my picture on him the night he died !And there was that boy that every girl in the Delta had set her cap for! That beautiful, brilliant young Fitzhugh boy from Greene County!	Transcription	
412.625048	413.678094	TOM: What did he leave his widow?	Transcription	
413.987814	419.748596	AMANDA: He never married ! Gracious, you talk as though all of my old admirers had turned up their toes to the daisies !	Transcription	
419.903456	422.329763	TOM: Isn't this the first you've mentioned that still survives ?	Transcription	
422.477416	443.793803	AMANDA: That Fitzhugh boy went North and made a fortune - came to be known as the Wolf of Wall Street! He had the Midas touch, whatever he touched turned to gold! And I could have been Mrs Duncan J. Fitzhugh, mind you! But what did I do- I just went out of my way and picked your father !	Transcription	
443.937078	445.274308	LAURA [rising]: Mother, let me clear the table.	Transcription	
445.417582	459.175904	AMANDA: No, dear, you go in front and study your typewriter chart. Or practise your shorthand a little. Stay fresh and pretty! It's almost time for our gentlemen callers to start arriving. [She flounces girlishly toward the kitchenette.] How many do you suppose we're going to entertain this afternoon?	Transcription	
459.494062	462.009869	LAURA [alone in the dining-room]: I don't believe we're going to receive any, Mother.	Transcription	
462.082288	466.540558	AMANDA [reappearing, airily ] What? Not one - not one? You must be joking!	Transcription	
466.582809	473.850007	AMANDA: Not one gentleman caller? It can't be true ! There must be a flood, there must have been a tornado!	Transcription	
474.145765	487.528813	LAURA: It isn't a flood, it's not a tornado, Mother. I'm just not popular like you were in Blue Mountain. ... [Tom utters another groan. LAURA glances at him with a faint, apologetic smile. Her voice catching a little.] Mother's afraid I'm going to be an old maid.	Transcription	
530.478655	533.483699	LAURA: Hello, Mother, I was - [She makes a nervous gesture toward the chart on the Wall. AMANDA leans against the shut door and stares at LAURA with a martyred look.]	Transcription	
533.837233	538.60995	AMANDA: Deception ? Deception ? [She slowly removes her hat and gloves, continuing the sweet suffering stare. She lets the hat and gloves fall on the floor - a bit of acting.]	Transcription	
542.763982	557.000637	LAURA [shakily]: How was the DAR. meeting? Didn't you go to the DAR. meeting, Mother?	Transcription	
557.412925	574.976379	AMANDA [faintly, almost inaudibly]: - No. - No. [Then more forcibly.] I did not have the strength - to go to the DAR. In fact, I did not have the courage! I wanted to find a hole in the ground and hide myself in it for ever ! [She crosses slowly to the wall and removes the diagram of the typewriter keyboard. She holds it in front of her for a second, staring at it sweetly and sorrowfully - then bites her lips and tears it into two pieces.]	Transcription	
579.429086	583.282871	LAURA [faintly]: Why did you do that, Mother? [AMANDA repeats the same procedure with the chart of the Gregg alphabet.] Why are you ??	Transcription	
583.511355	589.360528	AMANDA: Why? Why? How old are you, Laura?	Transcription	
589.589011	591.416877	LAURA: Mother, you know my age.	Transcription	
591.691057	600.54554	AMANDA: I thought that you were an adult; it seems that I was mistaken. [She crosses slowly to the sofa and sinks down and stares at LAURA.]	Transcription	
600.728326	605.206599	LAURA: Please don't stare at me, Mother.	Transcription	
605.709263	613.020729	AMANDA: What are we going to do, what is going to become of us, what is the future?	Transcription	
614.0488	622.144435	LAURA: Has something happened, Mother? [AMANDA draws a long breath and takes out the handkerchief again. Dabbing process.] Mother, has - something happened?	Transcription	
622.870957	630.862691	AMANDA: I'll be all right in a minute, I'm just bewildered [Count five.] - by life. ...	Transcription	
631.1533	634.301559	LAURA: Mother, I wish that you would tell me what's happened!	Transcription	
635.560862	651.302158	AMANDA: As you know, I was supposed to be inducted into my office at the D.A.R. this afternoon.  But I stopped off at Rubicam's business college to speak to your teachers about your having a cold and ask them what progress they thought you were making down there.	Transcription	
651.544332	652.419277	LAURA: Oh....	Transcription	
652.707231	755.689744	AMANDA: I went to the typing instructor and introduced myself as your mother. She didn't know who you were. Wingfield, she said. We don't have any such student enrolled at the school! I assured her she did, that you had been going to classes since early in January. 'I wonder,' she said, 'if you could be talking about that terribly shy little girl who dropped out of school after only a few days' attendance?' 'No,' I said, 'Laura, my daughter, has been going to school every day for the past six weeks !' 'Excuse me,' she said. She took the attendance book out and there was your name, unmistakably printed, and all the dates you were absent until they decided that you had dropped out of school. I still said, 'No, there must have been some mistake I There must have been some mix-up in the records !' And she said, 'No - I remember her perfectly now. Her hands shook so that she couldn't hit the right keys ! The first time we gave a speed-test, she broke down completely - was sick at the stomach and almost had to be carried into the wash-room! After that morning she never showed up any more. We phoned the house but never got any answer' -while I was working at Famous and Barr, I suppose, demonstrating those - Oh! I felt so weak I could barely keep on my feet ! I had to sit down while they got me a glass of water ! Fifty dollars' tuition, all of our plans - my hopes and ambition for you - just gone up the spout, just gone up the spout like that. [LAURA draws a long breath and gets awkwardly to her feet She crosses to the victrola and winds it up.] Oh, don't do that, Laura, don't play that big trolla. 	Transcription	
755.81874	757.882668	LAURA: Oh I [She releases the handle and returns to her seat.]	Transcription	
761.521474	766.293448	AMANDA: Laura? Laura, where have you been going when you've gone on pretending that you were going to business college ?	Transcription	
766.540559	767.899669	LAURA: I've just been going out walking.	Transcription	
768.308412	769.726578	AMANDA: That's not true.	Transcription	
769.895408	773.609652	LAURA: It is. I just went walking.	Transcription	
773.879779	784.443128	AMANDA: Walking? Walking? In winter? Deliberately courting pneumonia in that light coat? Where did you walk to, Laura?	Transcription	
784.695777	789.888583	LAURA: All sorts of places - mostly in the park.	Transcription	
790.070787	792.894945	AMANDA: Even after you'd started catching that cold?	Transcription	
793.077149	801.553093	LAURA: It was the lesser of two evils, Mother. [IMAGE: WINTER SCENE IN PARK.] I couldn't go back up. I threw up -on the floor !	Transcription	
801.866238	810.69634	AMANDA: From half past seven till after five every day you mean to tell me you walked around in the park, because you wanted to make me think that you were still going to Rubicam's Business College?	Transcription	
810.884445	816.113773	LAURA: It wasn't as bad as it sounds. I went inside places to get warmed up	Transcription	
816.236919	817.375045	AMANDA: Inside where?	Transcription	
817.575891	839.702181	LAURA: I went in the art museum and the bird-houses at the Zoo. I visited the penguins every day! Sometimes I did without lunch and went to the movies. Lately I've been spending most of my afternoons in the jewel-box, that big glass-house where they raise the tropical flowers.	Transcription	
840.116013	844.86082	AMANDA: You did all this to deceive me, just for deception? [LAURA looks down.] Why?	Transcription	
845.193783	853.18497	LAURA: Mother, when you're disappointed, you get that awful suffering look on your face, like the picture of Jesus' mother in the museum !	Transcription	
853.267666	853.929702	AMANDA: Hush !	Transcription	
854.064834	855.353405	LAURA: I couldn't face it.	Transcription	
859.795585	947.231093	AMANDA [hopelessly fingering the huge pocketbook]: So what are we going to do the rest of our lives? Stay home and watch the parades go by? Amuse ourselves with the glass menagerie, darling? Eternally play those worn-out phonograph records your father left as a painful reminder of him? We won't have a business career - we've given that up because it gave us nervous indigestion ! [Laughs wearily.] What is there left but dependency all our lives? I know so well what becomes of unmarried women who aren't prepared to occupy a position. I've seen such pitiful cases in the South - barely tolerated spinsters living upon the grudging patronage of sister's husband or brother's wife ! - stuck away in some little mousetrap of a room - encouraged by one in-law to visit another - little birdlike women without any nest - eating the crust of humility all their life ! Is that the future that we've mapped out for ourselves? I swear it's the only alternative I can think of ! It isn't a very pleasant alternative, is it? Of course - some girls do marry! [LAURA twists her hands nervously.] Haven't you ever liked some boy?	Transcription	
947.919604	953.173106	LAURA: Yes. I liked one once. [Rises.] I came across his picture a while ago.	Transcription	
953.358393	954.692875	AMANDA [with some interest]. He gave you his picture?	Transcription	
954.791725	956.398045	LAURA: No, it's in the year-book.	Transcription	
956.447471	958.177354	AMANDA: [disappointed]: Oh - a high-school boy.	Transcription	
958.300917	967.073897	LAURA: Yes. His name was Jim. [LAURA lifts the heavy annual from the claw-foot table.] Here he is in The Pirates of Penzance.	Transcription	
967.296311	968.000853	AMANDA [absently]: The what?	Transcription	
968.149387	984.903522	LAURA: The operetta the senior class put on. He had a wonderful voice and we sat across the aisle from each other Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays in the Aud. Here he is with the silver cup for debating !See his grin?	Transcription	
985.32519	987.43353	AMANDA [absently]: He must have had a jolly disposition.	Transcription	
988.843471	992.125778	LAURA: He used to call me - Blue Roses.	Transcription	
992.419629	994.423161	AMANDA: Why did he call you such a name as that?	Transcription	
994.636871	1037.227469	LAURA: When I had that attack of pleurosis - he asked me what was the matter when I came back. I Said pleurosis he thought that I said Blue Roses ! So that's what he always called me after that. Whenever he saw me, he'd holler, 'Hello, Blue Roses ! I didn't care for the girl that he went out with. Emily Meisenbach. Emily was the best-dressed girl at school. She never struck me, though, as being sincere. . . . It says in the Personal Section - they're engaged. That's a long time ago. They must be married by now.	Transcription	
1037.600818	1046.971369	AMANDA: Girls that aren't cut out for business careers usually wind up married to some nice man. [Gets up with aspark of revival.] Sister, that's what you'll do !	Transcription	
1048.103062	1048.949671	LAURA: But, Mother	Transcription	
1049.016572	1049.76931	AMANDA: Yes ? [Crossing to photograph.]	Transcription	
1050.607386	1052.479543	LAURA [in a tone of frightened apology]: I'm - crippled !	Transcription	
1052.561443	1078.764844	AMANDA: Nonsense ! Laura, I've told you never, never to use that word. Why, you're not crippled, you just have a little defect - hardly noticeable, even! When people have some slight disadvantage like that, they cultivate other things to make up for it - develop charm - and vivacity and - charm! That's all you have to do ![She turns again to the photograph.] One thing your father had plenty of - was charm!	Transcription	
1099.338967	1119.936237	TOM: After the fiasco at Rubicam's Business College, the idea of getting a gentleman caller for Laura began to play a more and more important part in Mother's calculations. It became an obsession. Like some archetype of the universal unconscious, the image of the gentleman caller haunted our small apartment. ...	Transcription	
1120.534498	1175.962735	TOM: Even when he wasn't mentioned, his presence hung in Mother's preoccupied look and in my sister's frightened, apologetic manner - hung like a sentence passed upon the Wingfields ! Mother was a woman of action as well as words. She began to take logical steps in the planned direction. Late that winter and in the early spring - realizing that extra money would be needed to properly feather the nest and plume the bird - she conducted a vigorous campaign on the- telephone, roping in subscribers to one of those magazines for matrons called The Home-maker's Companion, the type of journal that features the serialized , sublimations of ladies of letters who think in terms of eyes like wood-smoke in autumn, fingers that soothe and caress like strains of music, bodies as powerful as Etruscan sculpture.	Transcription	
1177.826985	1250.017853	AMANDA: Ida Scott? This is Amanda Wingfield! We missed you at the D.A.R. meeting last Monday! I said to myself: She's probably suffering with that sinus condition ! How is that sinus condition? Horrors ! Heaven have mercy !- You're a Christian martyr, yes, that's what you are, a Christian martyr ! Well, I just have happened to notice that your subscription to the Companion's about to expire! Yes, it expires with the next issue, honey !- just when that wonderful new serial by Bessie Mae Hopper is getting off to such an exciting start. Oh, honey, it's something that you can't miss !You remember how 'Gone With the Wind' took everybody by storm? You simply couldn't go out if you hadn't read it. All everybody talked was Scarlet O'Hara. Well, this is a book that critics already compare to Gone With the Wind. It's the 'Gone With the Wind' of the post-World War generation! - What? -Burning !- Oh, honey, don't let them burn, go take a look in the oven and I'll hold- Heavens - I think she's hung up ! ... Oh, Tom! Tom, do you know what she did? She hung up on me. 	Transcription	
1250.118766	1253.521002	LAURA: Mother, Mother! Tom's trying to write!	Transcription	
1253.618992	1260.77231	AMANDA: Oh? So he is... So he is! Why can't you sit up straight?	Transcription	
1260.838563	1265.050215	TOM: Mother! Please go busy yourself with something else. I'm trying to write	Transcription	
1265.141261	1271.182793	AMANDA: Now, I've seen a medical chart. And I know what that position does to your internal organs! Now you sit up and I'll shoo!	Transcription	
1271.225817	1272.507541	TOM: What in Christ's name am !	Transcription	
1272.310625	1273.79844	AMANDA [shrilly]: Don't you use that -	Transcription	
1272.529421	1273.404606	TOM: Supposed to do !	Transcription

1292.406787	1307.512536	AMANDA: I took that horrible novel back to the library- yes ! That hideous book by that insane Mr. Lawrence. [Tom laughs wildly.] I cannot control the output of diseased minds or people who cater to them - [Tom laughs still more wildly.] BUT I WON'T ALLOW SUCH FILTH BROUGHT INTO MY HOUSE ! NO, no, no, no, no !	Transcription

1317.407802	1318.637238	TOM: I don't want to hear any more! [He tears the portières open. The upstage area is lit with a turgid smoky red glow.]	Transcription	
1318.698101	1319.647567	AMANDA: You will hear more, you -	Transcription	
1319.684085	1321.120456	TOM: No, I won' t hear more, I'm going out !	Transcription

1325.542429	1326.492358	TOM: Oh, go -	Transcription	
1326.545132	1327.125644	LAURA [desperately]: Tom !	Transcription	
1327.239591	1331.668813	AMANDA: You're going to listen, and no more insolence from you ! I'm at the end of my patience !	Transcription	
1331.764065	1344.189399	TOM: What do you think I'm at the end of? Aren't I supposed to have any patience to reach the end of, Mother? I know, I know. It seems unimportant to you, what I'm doing - and what I want to do - having a slight difference between them !You don't think -	Transcription	
1344.353385	1373.366386	AMANDA: I think you've been doing things that you're ashamed of. That's why you act like this. I don't believe that you go every night to the movies every night. Nobody goes to the movies night after night. Nobody in their right mind goes to the movies as often as you pretend to. People don't go to the movies at nearly midnight, and movies don't let out at two a.m. Come in stumbling. Muttering to yourself like a maniac! You get three hours' sleep and then go to work. Oh, I can picture the way you're doing down there. Moping, doping, because you're in no condition.	Transcription	
1373.445344	1375.261386	TOM [wildly]: No, I'm in no condition !	Transcription	
1375.314025	1381.262221	AMANDA: What right have you got to jeopardize your job - jeopardize the security of us all? How do you think we'd manage if you were -	Transcription	
1381.31486	1428.235399	TOM: Listen !You think I'm crazy about the warehouse? [He bonds fiercely toward her slight figure.] You think I'm in love with the Continental Shoemakers? You think I want to spend fifty- five years down there in that - celotex interior!  Look! I'd rather somebody picked up a crowbar and battered out my brains - than go back mornings! But I go ! Every time you come in yelling……… that God damn 'Rise and Shine!'- 'Rise and Shine!' I say to myself, 'How lucky dead people are ! 'But I get up. I go! For sixty-five dollars a month I give up all that I dream of doing and being ever! And you say self - selfs' all I ever think of. Why, listen, if self is what I thought of, Mother, I'd be where he is -G O N E ! [Pointing to fathers picture.] As far as the system of transportation reaches ! [He starts past her. She grabs his arm.] Don't grab at me, Mother !	Transcription	
1428.269812	1430.66723	AMANDA: I'm not grabbing at you, I just wanna know where are you going?	Transcription	
1430.703976	1431.549101	TOM: I'm going to the movies!	Transcription	
1431.584127	1433.191997	AMANDA: I don't believe that lie !	Transcription	
1433.275883	1494.605337	TOM [crouching toward her, overtowering her tiny figure. She backs away, gasping]: No? Well, you're right. For once in your life you're right. I'm going to opium dens ! Yes, opium dens, dens of vice and criminals' hang-outs, Mother. I've joined the Hogan gang, I'm a hired assassin, I carry a tommy-gun in a violin case! I run a string of cathouses in the Valley! They call me Killer, Killer Wingfield, I'm leading a double-life, a simple, honest warehouse worker by day, by night a dynamic tsar of the underworld, Mother. I go to gambling casinos, I spin away fortunes on the roulette table ! I wear a patch over one eye and a false moustache, sometimes I put on green whiskers. On those occasions they call me -El Diablo ! Oh, I could tell you things to make you sleepless ! My enemies plan to dynamite this place. They're going to blow us all sky-high some night ! And will I be glad, and so will you ! You'll go up, up on a broomstick, over Blue Mountain with seventeen gentlemen callers! You ugly - babbling old - witch. [He goes through a series of violent, clumsy movements, seizing his overcoat, lunging to do door, pulling it fiercely open. The women watch him, aghast. His arm catches in the sleeve of the coat as he struggles to pull it on. For a moment he is pinioned by the bulky garment. With an outraged groan he tears the coat of again, splitting the shoulder of it, and hurls it across the room. It strikes against the shelf of Laura's glass collection, there is a tinkle of shattering glass. LAURA cries out as if wounded.]	Transcription	Transformation
1494.792208	1496.758811	LAURA [shrilly] : Oh! Help! My glass ! - menagerie. . . . [She covers her face and turns away.]	Transcription	
1497.890936	1505.728721	AMANDA [in an awful voice]: I won't speak to you - until you apologize ! [She crosses through portières and draws them together behind her. TOM is left with LAURA. LAURA Clings weakly to the mantel with her face averted. TOM stares at her stupidly for a moment. Then he crosses to shelf. Drops awkwardly on his knees to collect the fallen glass, glancing at LAURA as if he would speak but couldn't.]	Transcription
